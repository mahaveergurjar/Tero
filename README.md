# 🌱 Tero

Tero is a web-based platform designed to help farmers predict crop yield
based on various parameters like crop type, soil type, and location.\
The project also provides a smooth, user-friendly interface

## 🚀 Features

- Modern, responsive UI (inspired by Axiom Protocol design).
- **About Section** (top-left corner) -- Short description with
  project **Vision & Mission** (content to be provided by Hitesh).
- **Yield Predictor** -- Central button on homepage that redirects to
  the prediction page.
- **Language Selector** (top-right corner) -- API-powered language
  translation for:
  - Entire UI
  - Prediction results from the ML model
- **Interactive Flipcards** -- Show steps/demo data below the hero
  section.
- **FAQ Section** -- Expandable Q/A cards (like Axiom Protocol sample
  site).
